# Explorations-of-the-Holonomy-of-the-Rolling-Sphere
Code used to obtain a rectangle, parametrized by $(\vartheta, \varphi_1, \varphi_2)$, which when traced yields a rotation ${\bf R}(\psi,{\bf s})$.

To run this code, download it in a repository and run 'main.m'.
The code is an application of Appendix B to the rotation ${\bf R}(\psi=\frac{3\pi}{2},{\bf s} = 0.1{\bf E}_1+\sqrt{98}{\bf E}_2+0.1{\bf E}_3)$.
